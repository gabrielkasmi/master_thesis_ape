Here is the dataset in .csv format. It is a direct conversion from the original .dta file. I then broke it up into several smaller pieces, the whole dataset weighting 1.3 Gb.
The files are named xaa.csv to xff.csv. Each subfile contains 10,000 rows (for a total of about a million). The ordering of the files is xaa.csv, xab.csv, ..., xff.csv.
