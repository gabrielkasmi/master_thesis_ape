# master_thesis_ape
Repository containing the main documents I used for my 2018 master dissertation in economics. This was part of the Analysis and Policy in Economics (APE) curriculum.


This dissertation was defended in September 2018 at the Paris School of Economics (Paris, France). It dealt with French MPs and how belonging to the majority impacted their work. The main result is a specialization among MPs depending on whether they are member of the majority or not. This is roughly in line with earlier literature on the topic. 

I used the data gathered by Regards Citoyens and available on their website dedicated to the monitoring of MPs, nosdeputes.fr.
